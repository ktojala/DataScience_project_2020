### A. Title of the project    
Helsinki cycling data and weather
            
### B. Elevator pitch [max 400 characters]
Helsinki is investing a lot in new bicycle routes and city bikes. How weather affects cycling is not that much discussed.
Combining cycling data with weather data should give interesting results for eg. bicycle shops, city planners and to cyclists themselves.
There is a huge amount of data available. Challenges are to find the most relevant data combinations and their effective visualization.       
            
### C. Data: sources, wrangling, management  
general cycling data:

citybike data:

weather data:

Wrangling: At least cycling data is in a good format already - fmi weather data is quite tidy. There might be some work to get data from different sources to be compatible with each other. Also have to decide how to handle missing data points and select the most proper data
Management: Csv-files are probably enough?    
            
### D. Data analysis: statistics, machine learning    
Statistical methods: overall graphical comparisons, multivariate linear regression
Whatâ€™s the most useful data from eg. weather data? How should we limit data geographically?

### E. Communication of results: summarization & visualization
The end product would be some kind of visualization or report?            
How to visualize and explain results clearly?

### F. Operationalization: creating added value, end-user point of view
Target audience: cyclists, city planners, bicycle shops
